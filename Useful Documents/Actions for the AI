Move Action:
- Get to range for an action
- Get to safety (Mostly for ranged and casters)
- Get up
- Swap weapon

Standard Action:
- Melee Attack
- Trip
- Ranged Attack
- Cast a spell

Full Round Action:
- Full Attack


The deciding factor is which Standard or Full Round Action to take. Move actions only determine how safe or possible the other actions are.
