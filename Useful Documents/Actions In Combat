At the start of combat, every unit rolls for initiative (1d20 + DEX modifier). Units are ordered in descending order of their initiative score, and any tie is solved with a seconds roll between the tied units. Units then take their turns in order.

During a turn, a unit has a move action and a standard action to use. They may use a second move action instead of their standard action, but not the other way round. Another option is to forgo both actions for a full round action. Besides, units have an attack of opportunity they may use when not in their turn, under certain circumstances.
Things players can do as an action are as following:

Move action:
- Move up to your speed. (Check if i should see if diagonal movements are valid)
- Get up if prone.
- Swap weapons.

Standard action:
- Melee attack.
- Trip.
- Ranged attack.
- Cast a spell. (Probably one damage AoE spell, one healing spell, some attack/defense buff, CC spell)

Full round action:
- Full attack.
